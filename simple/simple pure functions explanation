def pureFunction(name : String) = s"My name is $name"
def impureFunction(name : String) = println(s"My name is $name")

A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent values x.
With no side effects!

I/O Monad isn't referentially transparent on its's own, because it changes the output type. (String -> Unit in example code)
But it is pure in it's nature meaning.

def actionOne: Double = 0.0 + 1.0
def actionTwo: Double = 0.0 - 1.0

def pureFunction = {
  def temp = actionOne + actionTwo
  temp
}

pureFunction
