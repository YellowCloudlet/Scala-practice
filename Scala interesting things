-> infinity + anything in java does not give an overloaded stack
-> An important lesson from the for loop examples is that when you use the for / yield
combination with a collection, you’re building and returning a new collection, but when
you use a for loop without yield , you’re just operating on each element in the collection
—you’re not creating a new collection.
