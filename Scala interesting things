-> infinity + anything in java does not give an overloaded stack
-> An important lesson from the for loop examples is that when you use the for / yield
combination with a collection, you’re building and returning a new collection, but when
you use a for loop without yield , you’re just operating on each element in the collection
—you’re not creating a new collection.
-> Adding yield to a for loop essentially places the result from each loop iteration into a
temporary holding area. When the loop completes, all of the elements in the holding
area are returned as a single collection. 
-> The map method has an implicit loop, and in that loop, it passes one
Char at a time to the algorithm it’s given.
